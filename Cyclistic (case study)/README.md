# Google Data Analytics course - Case study

## Introduction
As part of my studies within the Google Data Analytics course, I have completed one of the case studies provided. In order to answer the business question posed, I analysed the data of a fictional company and created a report on the results.

### About the company
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company with more than 5,800 geotracked bicycles and 600 docking stations. “The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.”

### About the data
For the analysis, I used the 2024-year historical trip data from the [public datasets](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) provided by Motivate International Inc. The datasets were made available under the following [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Due to data-privacy concerns, users’ personally identifiable information was unavailable.

### Business question: 
“How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”
