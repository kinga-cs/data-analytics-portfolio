## Introduction

### About the company
Cyclistic is a (fictional) "bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. (...) The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members."
